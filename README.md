# react-native-video360

React Native module to play 360 videos, using the SGPlayer for iOS, and Google VR for Android, this plugin was tested using react native 0.61

[![360](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davichoso/react-native-video360/master/360.png "360")](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davichoso/react-native-video360/master/360.png "360")

## Getting started
`npm i react-native-video360plugin --save`

### Notes
- This component was tested in React Native 0.61 with automatic linking, but I think that it should work in older versions linking manually.
- don't forget to run 'pod install' in iOS folder
	cd ios && pod install
- in Android test in a real device or android Q simulator I don't know but VR SDK fails in a lot of simulators but not in real devices.
- in iOS if you want to run in a real device go to Pods-> Development Pods -> react-native-video-360 -> react-native-video360.podspec open it and uncoment production and comment simulator lines, then run 'pod install' again. I wanted to build the framework for all architectures but it didn't worked, ill try to fix this in the future
- To archive you need change Build Settings Architectures to from `$(STANDARD_ARCHS)` to `arm64` and `arm64s`, and Enable Bitcode to `no`

```
# dev simulator
 # s.ios.vendored_frameworks = 'Frameworks/SGPlayer.framework','Frameworks/SGPlatform.framework'
 # production
 s.ios.vendored_frameworks = 'Frameworks/arm/SGPlayer.framework','Frameworks/arm/SGPlatform.framework'
```
### IOS USAGE
```javascript
<Video360 urlVideo={videoUrl} modeVideo={modeVideo} style={{ flex: 1}} />
```
Video Modes
```
 if(modeVideo == 1)
      _playerView.demoType = DemoType_AVPlayer_VR;
    if(modeVideo == 2)
      _playerView.demoType = DemoType_AVPlayer_VR_Box;
    if(modeVideo == 3)
      _playerView.demoType = DemoType_AVPlayer_Normal;
```
but I use like this, wraping it in a modal that is  triggered by a button that sets the url and the video mode.

```javascript
<Modal>
	<View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'black' }}>
		<View style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 20, left: 15, zIndex: 10 }}>
		<TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={() => { setModalVisible(false)}}>
		<Text style={{ color: 'white' }}>close</Text>
		</TouchableWithoutFeedback>
		</View>
	<Video360 urlVideo={videoUrl} modeVideo={modeVideo} style={{ flex: 1}} />
	</View>
</Modal>

```
#### video modes
```javascript
if(modeVideo == 1)
      _playerView.demoType = DemoType_AVPlayer_VR; // 360
    if(modeVideo == 2)
      _playerView.demoType = DemoType_AVPlayer_VR_Box; // 360 with glases
    if(modeVideo == 3)
      _playerView.demoType = DemoType_AVPlayer_Normal; // normal
```
## Android Usage
same as ios
```javascript
<Video360 urlVideo={videoUrl} modeVideo={modeVideo} style={{ flex: 1}} />
```
it also can have this props
```
volume={1}
displayMode='embedded'
enableInfoButton={true}
enableFullscreenButton={true}
enableCardboardButton={true}
enableTouchTracking={true}
hidesTransitionView={false}
```
